# Raspberry
Raspberry Pi Experiments in my free time.

This repository contains all projects I made using my raspberry pi.

<h3>1. WebControlledSocket</h3>
Web controlled power sockets.
Part of the script / images were taken from the following tutorial: http://www.instructables.com/id/Web-Controlled-8-Channel-Powerstrip/?ALLSTEPS
However, I customized the scripts to my needs and cleaned up redundant code.
As well as added a script which makes sure the relay status is set upon boot.
This prevents all connected devices to be powered on after a power loss.
